### Your Camera Gear is an online database that allows photographers and filmmakers to keep track of their photo/video equipment.

### Users can easily add/modify/delete items to their equipment list and have a clean and organized way of visualizing what they own. Additionally they can add items to a wishlist, to keep track of the things they would want to buy in the future.

### The Budget Overview feature displays the amount of money invested at the moment, and also show you for how much money you could seel your equipment for in the second hand market.
